## Why?
Because making rats is fun, even 
if you don't use them. I hate how
people actually use the rats they 
make, it's way more fun to just 
make them for fun.

### Obfuscation
Obfuscation uses 
tudbut.tools.encryption.RawKey from
TuddyLIB to encrypt. Here's how to
obfuscate the IP and webhook:

_fuck you, you filthy person 
who wants to use this to their 
advantage_ 

Read the code yourself! If you can't
you dont deserve to know it because
that means you just want to skid it
and NOT use it for edu purposes.
